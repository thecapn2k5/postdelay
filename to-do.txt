Time Zone
   prompt on first run or put a default
   auto-set the time zone on page load

cron
   make it autorun
   factor in time zone
   put in the command to actually post it

Add "loadPosts();" isn't loading the new post.
   I've already verified auto-commit
   I just made the page refresh.  This is ugly.  fix it.
